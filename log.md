# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 26, Friday 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the exercises and quiz for wk 9 of how to code: complex data. 

**Thoughts** 

learnt about abstract functions, when and how to use them with recursive function templates, like with lists and arbitrary arity trees

last night was confused as hell at 9pm by abstraction until I realised theres a difference between using it to create a function template for a fold function, and factoring out code from two similar functions.

this course is making me a lot more aware of recursivity
